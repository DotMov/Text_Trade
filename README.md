Dear Dr. Nicholson,
I have heard of your reputation as an amicable investor in young intellectuals of the computer science and information 
technology field. In fact, I am acquainted with some bright APSU alumni who got their project started with your backing. 
For that reason, I am writing you this letter to introduce my team and our project in the hope of finding an investor who 
sees the potential in our venture.
Eric Oliver, Seth Marks, and I, Linh Do make up the Trifecta Team. We are CS students at Austin Peay State University. 
Our project is an application named Text Trade that is basically a textbook marketplace and allows Austin Peay students 
to come together and buy or sell their used textbooks. 
As college students, we understand the financial struggle most of us live through. Cost saving is a top concern in every 
decision we make. It is not a myth that the textbook industries have been ripping off students for ages. On average, a 
college student spends around $500 each semester on textbooks. Many students sell their textbooks after the classes end 
to get some money back. The campus bookstore buys back used textbooks from these students for dirt cheap and sells them 
to other students for throat-cutting prices (usually four to six times higher than the buyback prices). That is why we, 
the Trifecta Team, strongly feel the need of creating a virtual marketplace where our young scholars can deal directly 
with one another and cut the greedy corporate bookstore off from the picture. We estimate that by using our Text Trade 
marketplace, college students on average can cut their textbook cost by two third each semester, which is roughly $700 
a year.
Our team plan to keep the application simple and easy to use. There will be two essential GUIs: one for users, and one 
for moderators. Each user has to register an account in order to start trading on Text Trade. The user then can create 
a list of books he wants to buy and/or sells. Each textbook entry must include all the necessary information such as 
title, author, edition, ISBN, associated course(s) that the textbook is used for, and book condition. A user can search 
for a book in the marketplace, find potential buyers, communicate with other traders, and report misdeeds to moderator. 
To keep things neat, we plan to implement the search algorithm based on ISBN numbers and course numbers. As for the 
moderatorâ€™s GUI, there are additional features that allow a moderator to manage the database, ban a disruptive user, or 
remove postings that sell non-textbook merchandises, etc. 
One might wonder what the advantages of using Text Trade over similar competitors such as eBay, Chegg, Amazon are. The 
answer is: specialization and localization. With Text Trade, school mates can easily find the exact book they need and 
carry out the transaction face-to-face. The shipping cost, waiting time, and fraudulent risk are eliminated. 
Even though our project has great growth potential and very practical application, there are some risks tagged along. 
First thing is the visual appeal of the application/interfaces. None of our team is strong in the visual design 
department. The second issue is the marketing aspect. We might make a good, practical piece of software, but if no one 
knows about it or uses it, our marketplace is useless. Therefore, we need funds to hire graphic designers and marketing 
strategists to ensure the success of this project.
I genuinely hope you will take our project into consideration. If you have any further question, please contact me using 
the information provided above. Our team greatly appreciate your time in reading through this letter. We hope to hear a 
favorable response from you soon.
Sincerely,
Linh N. Do
