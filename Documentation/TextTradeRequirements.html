			<p> Our project is an application named Text Trade that is basically a textbook marketplace and allows Austin Peay
			students to come together and buy or sell their used textbooks. 
			Our team plans to keep the application simple and easy to use. There will be two essential GUIs: one for users, 
			and one for moderators. Each user has to register an account in order to start trading on Text Trade. The user 
			then can create a list of books he wants to buy and/or sells. Each textbook entry must include all the necessary 
			information such as title, author, edition, ISBN, associated course(s) that the textbook is used for, and book 
			condition. A user can search for a book in the marketplace, find potential buyers, communicate with other traders, 
			and report misdeeds to moderator. To keep things neat, we plan to implement the search algorithm based on ISBN 
			numbers and course numbers. As for the moderator’s GUI, there are additional features that allow a moderator to 
			manage the database, ban a disruptive user, or remove postings that sell non-textbook merchandises, etc.
